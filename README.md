# Countdown-timer

 I developed a countdown timer for a website that starts from a set time and counts down to zero. It includes options to stop, reset, and restart the timer. 
 By using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created the countdown timer to begin when the user clicks the start button. 
 Users can also stop the timer using the stop button, restart it by clicking the restart button, and reset it using the reset button.
